### About

- This app was created to keep track of the users input of certain train lines.

- Information was placed in the 'Add Destination' table, and the logic that is ran on the front-end in javascript allowed for the the times to be updated to let the user know the times those specific trains were coming and at what frequency they were to arrive.

Access the live webapp: [Train Scheduler](https://maserallm.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)

### Overview

- On the load of the page, users can input their desired train destinations by typing in the Add Destination table the parameters required. After placing their input, pressing the submit button will add their destination information onto the 'Current Train Schedule' table.

- Refreshing the page will reset the input spaces, and the previous train lines inserted into the schedule will remain their.
